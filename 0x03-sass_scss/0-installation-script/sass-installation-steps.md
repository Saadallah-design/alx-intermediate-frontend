## First, install the SASS/SCSS
1. check you must have Node.js and npm
2. if you don't install them.
3. in terminal use: npm install -g sass (the -g is for global installation in your computer)
4. Check if it was successfully installed with: sass --version

#### if installed properly let's start.
1. create a new test directory or playground for your SASS and SCSS
        - in terminal: type <code>pwd</code> to check your present directory
        - create a directory: <code>mkdir sass-playground</code>
        - create a index and .scss file <code>touch styles.scss</code>
2. now in ur directory type the command: <code>sass --watch button.scss:button.css</code>
        - this will create a styles.css file and which ur scss will be changed to css and also show $
