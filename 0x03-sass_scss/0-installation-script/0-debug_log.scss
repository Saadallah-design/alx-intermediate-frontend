// This file is an attempt to print 'Hello World' to the console using only Sass/SCSS.
// Note: Sass/SCSS is not designed for console output, so this is a creative
// workaround that may not work in all environments.
// So, today I learned that you can use the @debug @warn and @error directive in Sass/SCSS to print messages to the console during compilation.
@debug 'Hello world';

// @warn 'Warning to the world';
// @error 'Error to the world';
