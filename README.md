# 📘 ALX Intermediate Frontend – Semantic HTML Practice 0x00

## 📝 Description
This repository contains my first practice projects in **semantic HTML** as part of the **ALX Prodev Frontend Development Program**.  
The goal of these exercises is to understand **how to structure web pages properly**, improve **accessibility**, and follow **best practices in HTML5**.

By working through these projects, I’m laying the foundation for more advanced frontend concepts such as CSS layouts, JavaScript interactivity, and responsive design.
