# ALX Intermediate Frontend - Tailwind CSS WEEK 2 | 0x02

This repository contains exercises and projects for learning **Tailwind CSS** by building responsive layouts using **Grid** and **Flexbox**.  
Each task builds progressively on the previous one, from setup to creating complex layouts.

### Personal takeway**: 

---> **PROBLEM** At first when I tried to install tailwind I didn't succeed. I checked which option is better to keep installing it for each project or install it globally. Global option sounded good to me so I proceeded with it. In Tailwind Docs I tried VITE  option but it didn't work because I didn't give it time and didn't want to proceed as it kept showing errors. I checked with CHATGPT but it gave me old setups only after checking the output it realizes that it was using an older setup. 

---> **REASON** I believe that I made some mistakes while installing it with vite in terms of files. For example creating a src/ manually where it is provided when you install tailwind. 

---> **LEARNING** Everything seems complicated at first because simply it is new. 
    therefore, I will get back to install VITE globally to see the underlying problem and understand more about VITE itself.
    
---> **SOLUTION** After error and trial and deleting directories for 2 hours I took a step back and read the TAILWIND DOCS. There was the option of CLI, I was already watching a video on it and the setup took only 5 minutes.

## ðŸš€ 0. Setting Up and Installing Tailwind CSS
**Objective:** Configure and install Tailwind CSS.

### Instructions
1. Install Tailwind CSS.
2. Create `tailwind.config.js`:
   ```js
   /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
   module.exports = {
     content: ["./src/**/*.{html,js}"],
     theme: {
       extend: {},
     },
     plugins: [],
   }
## IMPORTANT! Install tailwind using the Tailwind CLI way not vite. Through CLI is much easier to setup. 

### 1. Creating a Responsive CSS Grid Layout
#### File: 1-index.html

* **Objective**: Create a 3-column grid layout with responsive design.
- Use Tailwindâ€™s grid grid-cols-3 gap-4.
- Each column has increasing shades of blue:
    ```<div class="bg-blue-200 p-4">Column 1</div>
    <div class="bg-blue-300 p-4">Column 2</div>
    <div class="bg-blue-400 p-4">Column 3</div>```
- Add a responsive rule in input.css:
    ``` @media (max-width: 768px) {
    main { grid-template-columns: 1fr; }
    }```

### ðŸŸ© 2. Building a Complex Page Layout with Nested Grids
#### File: 2-index.html

    - Blue nested grid: bg-blue-200 grid grid-cols-2 p-4 gap-2
    - Red nested grid: bg-red-200 grid grid-cols-2 p-4 gap-2
